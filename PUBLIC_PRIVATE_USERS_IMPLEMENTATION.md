# Public/Private Users Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented public and private user functionality for the leaderboard system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/07-add-ispublic-column.sql`
- Added `isPublic` boolean column to Users table
- Set DEFAULT to `true` for new user registrations
- Updated all 6 existing users to `isPublic = false` (private)
- Created index on `isPublic` column for efficient filtering

### 2. Type Definitions
**File:** `server/types/index.ts`
- Added `isPublic?: boolean` to `User` interface
- Added `isPublic?: boolean` to `UserCreateData` interface (with note about database default)
- Added `isPublic?: boolean` to `UserUpdateData` interface

### 3. Data Access Layer
**Files:**
- `server/dal/interfaces/IUserDAL.ts`
- `server/dal/implementations/UserDAL.ts`

Added new method:
- `getPublicUsersWithTotalPoints()` - Filters users to only return those with `isPublic = true`

### 4. Leaderboard Service
**File:** `server/services/LeaderboardService.ts`
- Modified `getLeaderboard()` to use `getPublicUsersWithTotalPoints()` instead of `getAllUsersWithTotalPoints()`
- Leaderboard now automatically filters to show only public users

## Behavior

### Existing Users
- All 6 existing users have been marked as **PRIVATE** (isPublic = false)
- They will NOT appear on the leaderboard

### New Users
- All newly registered users will default to **PUBLIC** (isPublic = true)
- They WILL appear on the leaderboard

### Leaderboard Display
- Only shows users where `isPublic = true`
- Current leaderboard is empty since all existing users are private
- Will populate as new users register

## Test Results
✅ All tests passed:
- All existing users are marked as private
- Leaderboard filters to show only public users
- New users default to public
- Public users appear in leaderboard

**Test file:** `server/tests/test-public-private-users.cjs`

## User Control
As requested, **no user interface** has been added for toggling this setting. Users cannot change their privacy status through the application. This is a backend-only feature that:
- Protects existing users' privacy (all marked private)
- Allows new users to participate in leaderboard (default public)

## Database State After Migration
```
Total users: 6
Private users: 6
Public users: 0
Leaderboard showing: 0 users (empty until new users register)
```

## Implementation Complete
All requirements have been met:
- ✅ All new users default to public
- ✅ All existing users are marked as private
- ✅ Leaderboard only displays public users
- ✅ No user control/settings UI added
