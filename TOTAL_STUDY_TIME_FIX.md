# Total Study Time Display Fix

## Issue
The "Total Study Time" was always showing 0 minutes, even when users earned points during their session.

## Root Causes

### Problem 1: totalWorkPoints Never Incremented Locally
The `useWorkPoints` hook had logic to:
- Track daily points (`currentPoints`) ✓ Working
- Track total accumulated points (`totalWorkPoints`) ✗ Broken

When a user earned points, the code:
1. Incremented `millisecondsAccumulated` ✓
2. Calculated `currentPoints` from milliseconds ✓
3. **Never incremented `totalWorkPoints`** ✗

Result: `totalWorkPoints` stayed at 0 regardless of activity.

### Problem 2: totalWorkPoints Never Fetched from Server
The hook only loaded `totalWorkPoints` from localStorage, which was:
- Always 0 for new sessions
- Not synced with the authoritative database value
- Never fetched even though an API endpoint existed: `GET /api/users/:id/total-work-points`

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Increment totalWorkPoints When Earning Points
**File:** `src/hooks/useWorkPoints.ts`

Added logic to increment `totalWorkPoints` when daily points increase:

```typescript
// Trigger animation if points increased
if (newPoints > oldPoints) {
  setIsAnimating(true);
  
  // Increment total work points by the points earned
  const pointsEarned = newPoints - oldPoints;
  setTotalWorkPoints(prev => prev + pointsEarned);
  
  // ... rest of animation logic
}
```

**Result:** Total study time now updates in real-time as you earn points.

### Fix 2: Fetch totalWorkPoints from Server on Load
**File:** `src/hooks/useWorkPoints.ts`

Added API call to fetch the authoritative value from the database:

```typescript
const loadDataWithDailyCheck = async () => {
  // Fetch total work points from server
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${window.location.origin}/api/users/${user.id}/total-work-points`, {
      credentials: 'include'
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log('[WORK POINTS] Fetched total work points from server:', data.totalWorkPoints);
      // This will be used as the base, and we'll add today's points on top
      setTotalWorkPoints(data.totalWorkPoints || 0);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('[WORK POINTS] Failed to fetch total work points from server, using localStorage:', error);
  }
  
  // ... rest of data loading logic
}
```

**Result:** Users now see their cumulative study time from the database on page load.

## How It Works Now

1. **On Login/Page Load:**
   - Fetch `totalWorkPoints` from database via API
   - Display the cumulative total from all previous sessions

2. **During Active Session:**
   - Track activity and milliseconds
   - When points are earned, increment both:
     - `currentPoints` (today's points)
     - `totalWorkPoints` (lifetime total)
   - Sync daily points to server

3. **Display:**
   - `TimeDisplay` component shows `totalWorkPoints`
   - Updates in real-time as user earns points
   - Shows cumulative total across all sessions

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Log in to the application
2. Check browser console for: `[WORK POINTS] Fetched total work points from server: X`
3. Navigate to an eligible page (Entries, Reader, Flashcards)
4. Perform activity (typing, clicking, reading)
5. Watch the "Total Study Time" card update as you earn points

The time should now:
- Show your cumulative total on load (not 0)
- Increment as you earn new points
- Display in proper time format (hours, minutes)

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useWorkPoints.ts` - Added both fixes

## Related Components

- `src/components/TimeDisplay.tsx` - Displays the total study time
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Uses the `useWorkPoints` hook
- `server/controllers/UserController.ts` - Provides the API endpoint
