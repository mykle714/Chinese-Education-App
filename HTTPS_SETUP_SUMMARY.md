# HTTPS Setup Summary

## What Was Done (Local Changes)

I've prepared your project for HTTPS by updating three key files:

### 1. âœ… nginx.conf
- Added HTTPS server block listening on port 443
- Configured SSL certificate paths for Let's Encrypt
- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect on port 80
- Enabled modern TLS 1.2/1.3 protocols
- Added HSTS security header

### 2. âœ… docker-compose.prod.yml
- Changed from port 8080 to standard port 80 for HTTP
- Kept port 443 for HTTPS
- Added volume mount for SSL certificates: `/etc/letsencrypt`

### 3. âœ… HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Complete step-by-step instructions for server setup
- Troubleshooting guide
- Certificate renewal configuration
- Security best practices

## Next Steps (On Your Server)

Follow the **HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md** on your server:

1. **Commit and push** these changes to GitHub
2. **SSH to server** and pull the changes
3. **Install Certbot** (Let's Encrypt client)
4. **Obtain SSL certificate** for ilikemichael.duckdns.org
5. **Restart Docker** with new configuration
6. **Set up auto-renewal** via cron job
7. **Update router** port forwarding (80 and 443)
8. **Test** your app at https://ilikemichael.duckdns.org

## Quick Command Reference

On your server, you'll run:

```bash
# Pull changes
cd /var/www/vocabulary-app
git pull origin main

# Install Certbot
sudo apt install certbot -y

# Stop Docker temporarily
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Get certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d ilikemichael.duckdns.org

# Restart Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

## Result

Your app will be accessible at:
- **https://ilikemichael.duckdns.org** âœ… (secure)
- **http://ilikemichael.duckdns.org** â†’ automatically redirects to HTTPS

## Key Benefits

âœ… Free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt  
âœ… Auto-renewal every 90 days  
âœ… Standard ports 80/443 (no more :8080)  
âœ… Encrypted traffic  
âœ… Browser security (green padlock)  
âœ… Improved SEO
