# Test Users for Docker Development

This document lists the test users that are automatically created when you start fresh Docker containers.

## Automatic Test User Creation

When you run `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build`, the database initialization scripts automatically create 3 test users with different amounts of vocabulary data for comprehensive testing.

## Test User Credentials

All test users use the same password: **`testing123`**

- Test export functionality

### Performance & Features (`large@test.com`)
- Test pagination with larger dataset
- Longer flashcard sessions (50+ cards)
- Test search and filtering with more data
- Verify OnDeck vocab sets functionality
- Test bulk operations and CSV import
- Performance testing with realistic data volume

## Quick Login Commands

For easy testing, you can use these credentials:

```bash
# Empty state testing
Email: empty@test.com
Password: testing123

# Small dataset testing  
Email: small@test.com
Password: testing123

# Large dataset testing
Email: large@test.com
Password: testing123
```

## Data Reset

To get fresh test data:

```bash
# Reset all containers and data
docker-compose down -v

# Start fresh with clean test users
docker-compose up --build
```

This will recreate all 3 test users with their respective vocabulary data automatically.
